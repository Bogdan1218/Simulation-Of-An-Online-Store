# Simulation-Of-An-Online-Store
A short C++ console application meant to simulate basic actions of an online store using OOP principles.
The application provides the option to login as 2 types of users: ”Magazin” ( The administrator of the store ) and ”Client” ( A customer ). Based on the type of user chosen by you, you will need to provide an username and password to gain acces to any features.

* Magazin's authentication details:
  Username: magazin1
  Password: parola1
* Client's authentication details:
  Username: user1
  Password: parola1
  
The list of features created for an Administrator of the store:
  1. Add products to the store;
  2. Show the current list of products;
  3. Edit existing products from the store;
